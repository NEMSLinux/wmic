# wmic
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Command-Line Utility for NEMS Linux.

``wmic`` used to be part of the samba project, and since they deprecated it (years ago!) it started to become difficult to compile.

Big thanks to Andrew Bartlett from the Samba team for directing me to this script, removing our dependency on the old, unsupported Samba version.

Since initially introducing the script to NEMS Linux, it has undergone many revisions, including being reworked for Python 3.
