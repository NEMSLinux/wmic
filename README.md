# wmic
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Command-Line Utility for NEMS Linux.

``wmic`` used to be part of the samba project, and since they deprecated it (years ago!) it started to become difficult to compile. Enter this Python version, which has gone through a great deal of revisions since it is the implementation of wmic used by modern NEMS Linux.
