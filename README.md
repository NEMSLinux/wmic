# wmic
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Command-Line Utility for NEMS Linux.

``wmic`` used to be part of the Samba project, and since they deprecated back in 2009, it started to become difficult to compile.

Big thanks to Andrew Bartlett from the Samba team for directing me to an earlier version of this Python script, removing our dependency on the old, unsupported Samba version.

Since initially introducing the script to NEMS Linux, I've helped it through many iterations and revisions, including being reworked for Python 3 in NEMS Linux 1.6.
